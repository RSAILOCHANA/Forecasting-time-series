# Forecasting-time-series
a time series is any data set where the values are measured at different points in time. Many time series are uniformly spaced at a specific frequency, for example, hourly weather measurements, daily counts of web site visits, or monthly sales totals. Time series can also be irregularly spaced and sporadic, for example, timestamped data in a computer systemâ€™s event log or a history of 911 emergency calls. Pandas time series tools apply equally well to either type of time series.
